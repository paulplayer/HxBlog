# Rise and Shine

Rise and shine！

6 am and your hand can't make it to the alarm clock.

Before the voices in your head start telling you

that it's too early,too dark and too cold to get out of bed.

Aching muscles lie still in rebellion

Pretending not to hear your brain commanding them to move.

A legion of voices are shouting their unanimous premission

for you to hit the snooze button and go back to dreamland!

But you didn't ask their opinion.

The voice you've chosen to listen to is one of defiance!

The voice that said

there was a reason that you set that alarm in the first place.

So sit up.

Put your feet on the floor and don't look back

because we've got work to do.

Welcome to the grind!


For what is each day but a series of conflicts

between the right way and the easy way.

10,000 streams span out like a river delta before you

each one promising the path of least resistance.

The thing is you're headed upstream

and when you make that choice.

When you decide to turn your back on what's comfortable,what's safe

and what some would call common sense.

Well that's Day One.

From there is only gets tougher!

So just make sure this is something that you want.

Because the easy way out will always be there.

Ready to wash you away!

All you have to do is pick up your feet.

But you aren't going to are you.

With each step comes the decision to take another.

You're on your way now

but this is no time to dwell on how far you have come.

You're in a fight against an opponent you can't see.

But oh,you can feel him on your heels can't you.

Feel him breathing down your neck.

You know what that is?

That's YOU!

Your fears,your doubts,your insecurities，

all lined up like a firing squad ready to shoot you out of the sky.

But don't lose heart.

While they are not easily defeated,they are far from invincible.

Remember,this is the grind.

The Battle Royale between you and your mind.

Your body and the devil on your shoulders

who is telling you that this is just a game,

this is just a waste of time.

Your opponents are stronger than you.

Drown out the voice of uncertainty with sound of your own heartbeat!

Burn away your self-doubt with the fire beneath you.

Remember what we are fighting for.

And never forget that momentum is a cruel mistress.

She can turn on a dime with the smallest mistake.

She is ever searching for the weak place in your armor.

That one tiny feeling you forgot to prepare for.

So as long as the devil is hiding the details,the question remains.


Is that all you've got?

Are you sure?

When the answer is yes,

you've done all you can to prepare yourself for battle.

Then it's time to go forth and boldly face your enemy.

The enemy within!

Only now you must take that fight into the open.

Into hostile territory.

You are a lion in a field of lions.

All hunting the same elusive prey with a desperate starvation.

That says victory is the only thing that can keep you alive.

So believe that voice that says

you can run a little faster and you can throw a little hareder

that for you the laws of physics are merely a suggestion.

Luck is the last dying wish of those

who want to believe that winning can happen by accident.

Sweat on the other hand is for those who know it's a choice.

So decide now because destiny waits for no man.

And when your time comes.

And a thousand different voices are trying to tell you

that you're not ready for it.

Listen instead to that lone voive of descent,

that one voive that says:

"You are ready",

"You are prepared".

It's all up to you now!

So "RISE AND SHINE".
